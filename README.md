## Description

**well, in short, it's a fork of my old fetch - catfetch-ts, but whitout cats and with vertical variant(!)**

## Depedencies

`playerctl`

## Installation

**copy `fetch.sh` file to some directory and change it permition to run:**
```
chmod +x fetch.sh
```

## Using
```
fetch.sh         # horisontal version
fetch.sh v       # vertical version
```

**If you are going to use this fetch, I recommend writing an alias in .bashrc something like:**
```
alias fe="bash /path/to/fetch.sh"
```
