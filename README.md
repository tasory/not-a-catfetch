# Not-A-CatFetch

## Description

**well, in short, it's a fork of my old fetch - catfetch-ts, but whitout cats and with vertical variant(!)**

## Depedencies

`playerctl`

## Installation

**copy `fetch.sh` file to some directory and change it permition to run:**
```
chmod +x fetch.sh
```

## Using
```
fetch.sh         # horisontal version
